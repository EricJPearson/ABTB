<p class="HiRed">THIS IS JUST SOME NOTES I COLLECTED FROM OTHER CLUBS. </p>
<p class="HiRed">FOOD FOR THOUGHT ONLY!</p>
<p>What is an &quot;Alano Club&quot;?</p>
<p><span id="The_Twelve_Traditions_of_Alcoholics_Anonymous">An Alano Club is a nonprofit organization (basically a local charity) </span>that is set up to help an AA Group.  It is a nonprofit &quot;small business&quot; that is designed to work with AA Groups<span> within the framework of the </span><em><span>Twelve Traditions of Alcoholics Anonymous</span></em>.</p>
<ol>
  <li><em>Our common welfare should come first; personal recovery depends upon A.A. unity.</em></li>
  <li><em>For our group purpose there is but one ultimate authority—a loving God as He may express Himself in our group conscience. Our leaders are but trusted servants; they do not govern.</em></li>
  <li><em>The only requirement for A.A. membership is a desire to stop drinking.</em></li>
  <li><em>Each group should be autonomous except in matters affecting other groups or A.A. as a whole.</em></li>
  <li><em>Each group has but one primary purpose—to carry its message to the alcoholic who still suffers.</em></li>
  <li><em>An A.A. group ought never endorse, finance, or lend the A.A. name to any related facility or outside enterprise, lest problems of money, property, and prestige divert us from our primary purpose.</em></li>
  <li><em>Every A.A. group ought to be fully self-supporting, declining outside contributions.</em></li>
  <li><em>Alcoholics Anonymous should remain forever non-professional, but our service centers may employ special workers.</em></li>
  <li><em>A.A., as such, ought never be organized; but we may create service boards or committees directly responsible to those they serve.</em></li>
  <li><em>Alcoholics Anonymous has no opinion on outside issues; hence the A.A. name ought never be drawn into public controversy.</em></li>
  <li><em>Our public relations policy is based on attraction rather than promotion; we need always maintain personal anonymity at the level of press, radio, and films.</em></li>
  <li><em>Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our traditions, ever reminding us to place principles before personalities.</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Those traditions (especially 6 and 9) make it awkward for an AA group to sign a lease. That's why so many AA meetings are held in places that don't require a security deposit or a one-year commitment. </p>
<p>But that leaves a healthy, growing AA Group with no way to have a place that is &quot;theirs&quot; and that is available 24/7 for meetings.</p>
