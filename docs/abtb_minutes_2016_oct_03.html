    3 October 2016</strong></p>

<p>Meeting called to order by Bob at 6:45pm with a moment of silence and the serenity prayer.</p>
<p>Board Members Bob Eichenlaub, Candy Kniffin, Erin Taylor, Lynda Rothermel, Linda Tracy, Lisa Molmen,  and Eric Pearson  were in attendance.</p>
<p> Bob made a motion to accept the previous minutes.  Seconded by Erin; accepted unanimously.</p>
<p>Erin  made a motion to approve the Treasurer's report. Seconded by Linda; accepted unanimously.</p>
<p>Group expressed thanks to Bob for the signs.</p>
<p>Discussed problem with front door being left unlocked. We think efforts being made to let chairperson know it's their responsibility to lock the door will work.</p>
<p>Discussed what we should charge non-West End groups for use of the facility. Erin made a motion to accept 50% of basket. Seconded by Candy; accepted unanimously.</p>
<p>Lisa suggested that we no longer use Google docs to share and edit documents, just for viewing and/or personal use.</p>
<p>Bob will write an invitation to give to people, inviting them to join Alano By The Bay. Will be posted on Living In The Solution and other places.</p>
<p>Eric will print addresses on 200 envelopes. The plan is to hand them to people we know well enough to ask.</p>
<p>Lynda will check on getting mugs.</p>
Eric made a motion to close the meeting, Bob seconded. Everyone left.
 <p>Minutes respectfully submitted by Linda, transcribed by Eric.</p>
